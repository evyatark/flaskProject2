## Adding HTML files
using https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-a-web-application-using-flask-in-python-3

I added `index.html` file and a CSS file

## Add some forms and logic
I followed https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-a-web-application-using-flask-in-python-3 
and added a form to create new posts.

I do not use a database as in this example, instead I use a global variable named `posts`.
